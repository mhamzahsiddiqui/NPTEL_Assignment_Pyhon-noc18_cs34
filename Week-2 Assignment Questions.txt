1.	Write a function intreverse(n) that takes as input a positive integer n and returns the integer obtained by reversing the digits in n.
Here are some examples of how your function should work.
  >>> intreverse(783)
  387
  >>> intreverse(242789)
  987242
  >>> intreverse(3)
  3
2.	Write a function matched(s) that takes as input a string s and checks if the brackets "(" and ")" in s are matched: that is, every "(" has a matching ")" after it and every ")" has a matching "(" before it. Your function should ignore all other symbols that appear in s. Your function should return True if s has matched brackets and False if it does not.
Here are some examples to show how your function should work.
 
  >>> matched("zb%78")
  True
  >>> matched("(7)(a")
  False
  >>> matched("a)*(?")
  False
  >>> matched("((jkl)78(A)&l(8(dd(FJI:),):)?)")
  True
3.	Write a function sumprimes(l) that takes as input a list of integers l and retuns the sum of all the prime numbers in l.
Here are some examples to show how your function should work.
  >>> sumprimes([3,3,1,13])
  19
  >>> sumprimes([2,4,6,9,11])
  13
  >>> sumprimes([-3,1,6])
  0
